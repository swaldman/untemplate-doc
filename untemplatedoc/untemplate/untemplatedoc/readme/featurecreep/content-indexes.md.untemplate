When you generate a collection (usually a directory hierarchy) of untemplates,
you can request that the untemplate library generate an index of the untemplates
produced that you can work with at runtime.

Here is an example, indexing the unteplates generating this documentation:

```scala
<()
writer.writeln( Files.readString( indexGen ) )
()>
```
